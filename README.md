## About


This is a single page html application on the Pacmen Factory Exercise from the MIT xPro course.

The exercise is on how to create two buttons that would have two functionalities:

* The first would generate new Pacmen components on the page, as many as the user so desires, on click
* The second would give life to these Pacmen and animated them on the page, and accelerate them on each click.




### Built With
